# Air-pollution
The dataset â€œAir Pollution(Jadavpur)describes the values of different air pollutants like PM2.5 , PM10 , CO , NO ,NO2 etc hourly for each day of two consecutive months January and February. This dataset has 1440 rows and 11 columns. The problem is to forecast the value of the air pollutants by viewing the trend of their  values.
I here use multiple linear regression technique to solve it.
